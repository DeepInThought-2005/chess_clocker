# chess_clocker

Many of chess player have their own chessclocker, i have no money to buy my own one.
So I programmed with Python Tkinter.
Well, that is somehow better than i thought, i mean 100 times better!

!!!notice!!!

    To give a mode you need to input like this: 3+2 (it means 3 minutes and 2 second bonus every switch)!
    press left shift and right shift to switch
    To continue or to pause, press <space>!
